# Bossapy

This repository is where development of python version of connection to Bossa API algotrading interface takes place. 

This is an open-source project without affiliation to DM BO≈ö brokerage. So far no python bindings for Bossa API are avaliable thus the `bossapy` tries to fill that gap. 

The project was initially created by Fey and Jarek to facilitate data gathering, and we are planning to extend it with simple algotrading strategies via Bossa API in python ecosystem. We do all of our development work here. If you are willing to contribute you are welcome. 

This source code is available to everyone under the Apache v2.0 license.
