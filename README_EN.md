# Bossapy

Implementation of a algotrading service via the Bossa API in Python. It is an open-source project, not affiliated by the DM BO≈ö.

The project was created to facilitate algotrading via Bossa API  in Python.

The library is available under the Apache v2.0 license - along with the full, open one
source code. In this way, everyone uses it in their projects - maybe
no matter if it's a commercial or free project, open source or not...
The same rule applies that there should never be a mention of riots
authors (Jarek and Feyy) and all (if it happens
I will share my modifications, which of course I encourage).

For Polish version [PL version](README.md)
